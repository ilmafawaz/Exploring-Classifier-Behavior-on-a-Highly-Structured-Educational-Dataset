# Exploring-Classifier-Behavior-on-a-Highly-Structured-Educational-Dataset

Project Overview:
This project explores how different classification algorithms behave on a highly structured student performance dataset. The goal is not model optimization, but understanding how dataset characteristics influence classifier performance.

Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Key Observations:
All models achieved extremely high accuracy.
Decision Tree and Random Forest produced perfect classification results.
Feature engineering revealed clear, deterministic decision boundaries.
Model complexity did not improve performance due to the dataset’s structured nature.

Conclusion:
The results show that when datasets contain explicit score-based patterns, even simple classifiers can perform exceptionally well. This project emphasises interpreting results in the context of data structure rather than relying solely on accuracy metrics.
